# Repos API film generator web app

![MOCKUP](https://github.com/FAC9/repos_api_website/blob/master/ApiProject.png)

## Who?

This web app is for people who want to generate a random film to watch in response to a set of 3 filters:

1. genre 
2. release date
3. length

## What?
Core features:

A responsive web app that uses the The Movie Database(Tmbd) API to find the film data and will use the Giphy API to generate a gif in response to the film title. 

This will be activated by a 'generate' button and the gif and some basic information about the film will be displayed on a new page. This basic information will be:

1. title
2. genre
3. release year

Stretch Goals:

- Employ a further API to provide a location for watching the film. 


## Why?

To learn about using API's and to create a useful tool for people to find random films.

## HOW? 

- Using TDD
- Using at least 2 API's
- gitIgnore to hide the API key.
