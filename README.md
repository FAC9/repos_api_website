2. release date
3. length

## What?
Core features:

A responsive web app that uses the The Movie Database(Tmbd) API to find the film data and will use the Giphy API to generate a gif in response to the film title. On the home screen you will find a 'generate' button, this will take you to a new page where and the gif and some basic information about the film will be displayed on a new page. This basic information will be:

1. title
2. genres
3. release year

## Why?

To learn about using API's and to create a useful tool for people to find random films.

## How? 

- using TDD
- using at least 2 API's
- gitIgnore to hide the API key

## Stretch Goals
